![Flickr Friends Screenshot][ss]

Press the "i" and set your Flickr screen name &mdash; from now on the widget
will show a continuous slideshow of your Friends' recent uploads.

Please note your Flickr screen name is not your Yahoo username, or your Flickr
username, but is usually your full name (if you set it). Check by going to
[Flickr][fr]; where it says "Hi/Hello/OHAI foo" &mdash; *foo* is your screen
name.

I would apologise for this annoyance, but it is entirely Flickr's fault.

## Future Plans

* Square off images sensibly;
	* Long-thin images should not be stretched vertically &mdash; leave gaps
	* Clip the edges of slightly rectangular images
	* Blow up small mostly square images
* Show additional information on mouse over
	* eg. show who took the picture and their avatar
